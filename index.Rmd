## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to baseball. I want to determine the impact of notable individuals' hitting stats on their team's overall performance. I will be observing the effects of this starting from after the steroid era, in 2005. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Yearly_WAR_Leaders <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv")
Yearly_WAR_Leaders <- Yearly_WAR_Leaders |>
  select(Year:WAR, American.League:WAR.1)

Yearly_WAR_Leaders
```
